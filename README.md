# Overview
Intertrack project to build a platform that can predict if a customer will default in payment using demographic data and history of past payment. Estimation of this kind of risk has been done by statistical methods through decades and with respect to recent development in the field of machine learning, there has been an interest in investigating if machine learning techniques can perform better quantification of the risk. The aim of this project is to examine which method from a chosen set of machine learning techniques exhibits the best performance in default prediction with regards to chosen model evaluation parameters. The investigated techniques were Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine. The results showed that XGBoost without any threshold adjustment provided the best results. Upon adjustment of classification threshold a the XGBOOST model provided the best recall, precision value.
